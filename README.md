# SAP - Sia's Admin Panel 

> A modern, secure and structured moderation framework built specifically for ROBLOX experiences.

SAP (Sia's Admin Panel) is a lightweight yet powerful administration system designed for serious developers who care about security, clean architecture, and official moderation integration.

Unlike traditional admin scripts, SAP is built as a structured moderation framework - not a collection of improvised commands.

---

# 💖 What is SAP?

SAP provides real-time player management, secure ban handling, offline moderation tools, and a clean, modern interface - all while integrating directly with Roblox's official moderation infrastructure.

It is designed to:

- Avoid DataStore-based ban systems
- Avoid exploitable RemoteEvent structures
- Avoid cluttered, outdated admin UI designs
- Feel official, professional, and production-ready

---

# 🔒 Official Roblox Ban Integration

One of SAP's core strengths is its ban management system.

Unlike many admin tools (such as Adonis or Kohl's Admin) that store bans in DataStores or local systems, SAP uses **Roblox's official Ban API**.

This means:

- ✅ Bans are stored directly in your game's official moderation system
- ✅ Fully visible and manageable inside the Creator Hub
- ✅ No custom DataStore ban lists
- ✅ No unofficial bypass risks
- ✅ Cleaner, safer and more professional moderation

With SAP, you never need to manually open the Creator Hub to manage bans - everything is handled directly through Roblox's official infrastructure.

SAP is structured into modular systems:

- AdminService
- BanService
- MuteService
- Announcement system
- Lookup system
- Notification system

RemoteEvents are separated and validated as well.

All critical moderation logic is validated server-side.

SAP is built to feel like a framework - not a script.

# 🎯 Project Vision

It is built for developers who want:

- Official moderation integration
- Clean architecture
- Secure execution
- Professional UI design
- Structured development practices

The goal is simple:

> Make moderation feel official, structured, and safe - not improvised.
