#  SAP - Sia's Admin Panel

> A modern, lightweight and powerful administration framework built specifically for ROBLOX experiences.

SAP (Sia's Admin Panel) is designed for developers who want **secure, structured and professional moderation** - without messy DataStores, outdated systems or improvised admin scripts.

It combines a clean, performant UI with powerful moderation tools that give your staff full control - without clutter, confusion or risky workarounds.

## 🔒 Secure Ban Management (Official Roblox API)

One of SAP's core strengths is its **official Roblox API-based ban system**.

Unlike traditional admin tools such as Adonis or Kohl's, which store bans in DataStores or local scripts, SAP uses Roblox's official moderation infrastructure.

### What this means:

- ✅ Bans are stored directly in your game's official moderation system  
- ✅ Fully visible and manageable inside the Creator Hub  
- ✅ No custom DataStore-based ban lists  
- ✅ No unofficial or bypassable systems  
- ✅ Cleaner, safer and more professional moderation  

With SAP, you never need to manually manage bans through the Creator Hub - everything is handled directly through Roblox's official systems via SAP.

This ensures long-term reliability, security and proper system integration.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

SAP is not meant to be "just another admin script".

The goal is to create a **secure, structured and modern moderation framework** that feels official - not improvised.

SAP is built for serious developers who care about:

- Security  
- Clean system architecture  
- Long-term scalability  
- Professional moderation standards  

This is about building a real framework - not a quick in-game shortcut.
